    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am an aspiring researcher passionate about exploring <strong>AI4Science</strong>, <strong>Reasoning</strong>, and <strong>Multimodal LLMs</strong>. I am currently a Senior Undergraduate in Computer Science at NYU Shanghai, actively seeking opportunities to pursue original research and contribute to these rapidly evolving fields.</p>

    <div class="research-interests">
      <h3>Research Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI4Science</strong>: Applying artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discovery and research processes</li>
        <li><strong>Reasoning</strong>: Developing AI systems with enhanced logical reasoning and problem-solving capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Multimodal LLMs</strong>: Exploring large language models that can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Current Research</h3>
    <p>I am currently working with <strong>Professor Chen Zhao</strong> at NYU Shanghai on <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and QA systems</strong>, focusing on improving information retrieval and question-answering capabilities. Additionally, I am collaborating with <strong>Yale NLP</strong> under <strong>Professor Arman Cohan</strong> and <strong>Professor John Sous</strong> in the field of <strong>AI4Physics</strong>, exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics research.</p>
